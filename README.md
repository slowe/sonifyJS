sonifyJS
========

Turn images into sounds. 

This is my attempt to make it possible for the blind and partially sighted people to explore images. Uses the Web Audio API for sounds and <canvas> to read the RGB values in the image. The aim would be for this to be a simple, drop-in, Javascript to sonify specified images. It will be limited to images on the same domain due to web-browser security models.

A very basic version is working in Firefox.
